    // onPositionDiscontinuity callbacks (and, for song changes, the relay network
    // resolve) land LATER, asynchronously, by which time isApplyingRemote has already
    // flipped back to false. That race made a remote-applied change get re-broadcast
    // as if it were a fresh local action, causing the other device to receive an echo
    // and re-apply it - the ping-pong that showed up as sync delay / devices fighting
    // each other / playback occasionally getting stuck. suppressNextPlayPauseBroadcast
    // already solved this for applyRemotePlayPause; suppressNextSeekBroadcast does the
    // same for seeks (applyRemoteSeek and the seekTo() inside applyRemotePlayPause),
    // and applyRemoteSongChange now also arms suppressNextPlayPauseBroadcast so the
    // *delayed* isPlayingChanged that fires once the relay resolve finishes is caught
    // too, no matter how long that resolve takes.
    //
    // SAFETY-NET FIX: a "suppress the next event" flag is only safe if that next event
    // is guaranteed to actually happen. If a remote song change never actually reaches
    // isPlaying=true (relay stuck/failed, endless buffering), the flag stayed armed
    // forever - so the NEXT genuinely local pause/resume from the user silently got
    // swallowed and never reached Firebase (this is why pause sometimes stopped
    // syncing to the other device after a buffering hiccup). Both suppress flags now
    // carry an "armed at" timestamp and expire after suppressExpiryMs, so a stuck
    // remote apply can only eat broadcasts for a few seconds, never indefinitely.

    // legitimately take far longer than 8s. When a remote Jam song-change triggered
    // a slow resolve, the suppress flag expired WHILE we were still waiting on the
    // network - so the eventual onIsPlayingChanged(true)/seek, once the resolve
    // finally landed, got broadcast back to Firebase as if it were a brand new local
    // action. That produced an echo that could yank the position back to 0 / restart
    // the track on every other device, and is a big part of why Jam felt like it

    // playItunesTrack() right after THIS device's own resolve/buffering finishes.
    // Without this, every device just started a new track at 0:00 the instant its

    // even a few seconds longer than another's ended up permanently that far
