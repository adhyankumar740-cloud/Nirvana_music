    // onPositionDiscontinuity callbacks (and, for song changes, the stream network
    // resolve) land LATER, asynchronously, by which time isApplyingRemote has already
    // flipped back to false. That race made a remote-applied change get re-broadcast
    // as if it were a fresh local action, causing the other device to receive an echo
    // and re-apply it - the ping-pong that showed up as sync delay / devices fighting
    // each other / playback occasionally getting stuck. suppressNextPlayPauseBroadcast
    // already solved this for applyRemotePlayPause; suppressNextSeekBroadcast does the
    // same for seeks (applyRemoteSeek and the seekTo() inside applyRemotePlayPause),
    // and applyRemoteSongChange now also arms suppressNextPlayPauseBroadcast so the
    // *delayed* isPlayingChanged that fires once the stream resolve finishes is caught
    // too, no matter how long that resolve takes.

    // is guaranteed to actually happen. If a remote song change never actually reaches
    // isPlaying=true (stream stuck/failed, endless buffering), the flag stayed armed
    // forever - so the NEXT genuinely local pause/resume from the user silently got
    // swallowed and never reached Firebase (this is why pause sometimes stopped

    // a slow resolve, the suppress flag expired WHILE we were still waiting on the
    // network - so the eventual onIsPlayingChanged(true)/seek, once the resolve
    // finally landed, got broadcast back to Firebase as if it were a brand new local
    // action. That produced an echo that could yank the position back to 0 / restart
    // the track on every other device, and is a big part of why Jam felt like it
