    // YouTube search, direct-preview path removed) real songs are
    // TrackSource.YOUTUBE with previewUrl = "" (these tracks carry a
    // youtubeVideoId instead, resolved to real audio per-device via
    // InnerTubeService). So every Jam broadcast was
    // silently sending an EMPTY streamUrl + the wrong source tag. The
    // receiving device(s) then reconstructed a Track with no youtubeVideoId,
    // defaulted back to TrackSource.ITUNES, and tried to play an empty URI -
    // which is exactly why the song only ever played on the device that
    // started it (the only one with the real track data already loaded
    // locally) and buffered forever on every other device (empty/invalid URI
    // never resolves to real audio, so ExoPlayer just sits in
    // STATE_BUFFERING). Now both source and youtubeVideoId are carried
    // through properly, so every device does its own fresh relay resolve.
